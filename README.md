ReactSetup is my personal setup for react projects

I'll go to use this structure in a my future project called Act, which is a command line program to manage react projects

This isn't a definetly version and maybe it could even change radically.
Any suggestions or criticisms are welcome

It include:
- [x] [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [x] [Webpack Dev Server](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/)
- [x] [Tyepscript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [x] [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [x] [React Router v4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [x] [DotEnv for Webpack](https://github.com/mrsteele/dotenv-webpack)
- [x] [SASS/SCSS with node-sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [x] React Router Lazy Loading
- [ ] [Webpack Code Splitting](https://webpack.js.org/guides/code-splitting/)
- [ ] [Webpack Tree Shaking in production](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/)
- [ ] Fetch wrapper

Should I include:
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)?
- [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)?
- [Webpack Caching](https://webpack.js.org/guides/caching/)
- Separeted environment system?

### Public
The directory "public" has the aim to contains all the files exposed to the internet.

Here will be generated by webpack the bundle.js

### Src
Src is the directory which contains all the react side of the project.
The main parts of it are:
- index.tsx. It's the entry point of the project and it imports app.tsx
- environment.
- app.

### Environment
Environment is the directory which contains all the file usefull for the management of variables taken from the .env file
- environment.ts 


### App
The app directory contains all

- *app.tsx*. It's the main React Component and here there is the first integration with React Router. All the information about the routing are into the file app.routing.tsx
- *app.routing.ts*. Here all the routes of the app.tsx component are declareted.There will be an object called "routes", which is of type Route[], that contains which path associate to a specific component.<br/>
All the route can easly created by the function [createRoutes]() contained in the file [utils/routing.utils.tsx]()
- app.scss. It's the main style file in the project. All the others files will be included here.
