# ReactSetup

ReactSetup is my personal setup for react projects
It include:
- [x] [Tyepscript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [x] [React Router v4](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)
- [x] [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [x] [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [x] [DotEnv for Webpack](https://github.com/mrsteele/dotenv-webpack)

Should I include these?
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)?
- [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)?

This isn't a definetly version and maybe it could even change radically.
Any suggestions or criticisms are welcome
